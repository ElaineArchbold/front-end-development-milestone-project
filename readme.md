## Elaine Archbold User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

This is a contact and portfolio site for Ritchie Hogan. Ritchie is a friend of mine and has allowed me to use his name and photographs for this project.


## UX
My goal in the design is to display Ritchies porfolio of work, along with his contact details. I wanted to create a clean and simple look, with the photos speaking for themselves.


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4)
4. Photoshop


## Features
The home page features a scrolling parallax effect, with photo carousel and contact form.
The portfolio page includes a gallery lightbox made from a snippet taken from https://epicbootstrap.com/snippets/lightbox-gallery.
I used the hvr-sweep-to-bottom bootstrap function for the Navbar, and used teansitions for the buttons and links.


### Features Left to Implement
I would like to add a 'shop' page where people could purchase prints of the images and an 'upcoming events' page when Ritchie begins to display his work in public.


## Testing
I have set all of the footer links to the social media site homepage, apart from Instagram. Ritchies Instagram page is the only one he has currently set up. All links open in a new tab.

I used Google Developer Tools to check the responsiveness of the site.

All HTML was checked on the W3C Markup Validation Service.

The CSS was checked on the W3C CSS Validation Service.

All HTML was formatted on https://freeformatter.com.

## Deployment


### Content
All photographs used are those of Ritchie Hogan, and are being used for the purpose of this project with his permimssion.

### Media
All photos used are those belonging to Ritchie Hogan, and he has given permission to use them for the purpose of this project.
I used Photoshop to create the background image of Parallaxtwo. I used image adjustments to posterize a photo Ritchie had of himself. This is only visible on larger screens as I used a media query to change the background of this section in mobile devices.

### Acknowledgements
The footer content was taken and amended from the bootstrap resume mini-project with the Code Institute.

The media query for the responsive contact form on the home page was also taken and amended from the boostrap resume mini-project.

The responsive Navbar Javascript function was found on the 'Beyond Bootstrap' section in 'Bootstrapping your next big idea' on the course module with the Code Institute.
