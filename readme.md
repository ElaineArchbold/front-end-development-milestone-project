## Elaine Archbold User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

This is a contact and portfolio site for Ritchie Hogan. Ritchie is a friend of mine and has allowed me to use his name and photographs for this project.


## UX
My goal in the design is to display Ritchies porfolio of work, along with his contact details. I wanted to create a clean and simple look, with the photos speaking for themselves.


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4)


## Features
I have added a scrolling parallax to the home page, along with a photo carousel.


### Features Left to Implement
I would like to add a modal to have the images in the porfolio page appear in a lightbox.
I would also like to add an 'upcoming events' page when Ritchie begins to display his work in public.


## Testing
I have set all of the footer links to Ritchies Instagram page as he currently has no other official accounts set up. All links open in a new tab.

All HTML was checked on the W3C Markup Validation Service.

The CSS was checked on the W3C CSS Validation Service.
