## Elaine Archbold User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

This is a contact and portfolio site for Ritchie Hogan. Ritchie is a friend of mine and has allowed me to use his name and photographs for this project.


## UX
My goal in the design is to display Ritchies porfolio of work, along with his contact details. I wanted to create a clean and simple look, with the photos speaking for themselves.


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4)


## Features
The home page features a scrolling parallax effect, with photo carousel and contact form.
The portfolio page includes a gallery lightbox made from a snippet taken from https://epicbootstrap.com/snippets/lightbox-gallery.


### Features Left to Implement
I would like to add a 'shop' page where people could purchase prints of the images and an 'upcoming events' page when Ritchie begins to display his work in public.


## Testing
I have set all of the footer links to Ritchies Instagram page as he currently has no other official accounts set up. All links open in a new tab.

All HTML was checked on the W3C Markup Validation Service.

The CSS was checked on the W3C CSS Validation Service.



## Deployment


### Content
All photographs used are those of Ritchie Hogan, and are being used for the purpose of this project with his permimssion.

### Acknowledgements
The footer content was taken and amended from the bootstrap resume mini-project with the Code Institute.

The media query for the responsive contact form on the home page was also taken and amended from the boostrap resume mini-project.

The responsive Navbar Javascript function was found on the 'Beyond Bootstrap' section in 'Bootstrapping your next big idea' on the course module with the Code Institute.
